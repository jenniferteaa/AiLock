# AiLock
This project implements AiLock, an alternative to biometrics proposed and published in the research paper 'A Secure Mobile Authentication Alternative to Biometrics.

ai.lock is introduced as a secret image based authentication method for mobile devices which uses an imaging sensor to reliably extract authentication credentials similar to biometrics. In this project, we Implement ai.lock and test its efficiency particularly its Error Tolerance Threshold (ETT).
